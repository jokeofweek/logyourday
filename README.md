LogYourDay was the HackMIT project of [Dominic Charley-Roy](https://github.com/jokeofweek), [Sam Khan](https://github.com/sammyKhan), and [Xavier Denis](https://github.com/xldenis). It is combines Twitter-style microposts about what a user did with that day and data visualization tools in order to allow users to visualize trends in their daily lives.

We made LogYourDay using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com/), and [d3js](http://d3js.org/).
